//Variables 
//memory to store information
//when we create variables we reserve space in memory and we will try to be as memory effeciant as possible
//variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated by computer program
//types
//Boolean = bool = true/false
//integer = keyword = uint = value
//string = keyword = datavalues consisting of characters


//coco-price  = 10 = integer value
//coco-price  = 20 <-- new price of same variable = integer value
//store-owner = 300 = integer value 
// TotalValue = store-owner + coco-price 
// TotalValue = 320 because storeowner stores the value of 300 and coco-price stores price of 20 and
//value is then = to 320

// Three main types: Booleans, Integers and Strings
// Liedetector variable > Boolean because we want to check if what we are checking against is true or false
// whether statement is true or false is what we are checking with the variable

//walletAmount: if i want wallet amount then i need a integer that holds the amount because we are holding numerical values

// strings are characters stored
// errormessagetext = string that shows error message 'inside this bracket'

contract LearnVariables {
    //all out solidity code goes here
    uint ChocolateBar = 10; //Integer 
    uint StoreOwner = 300; //Integer 
    bool LieDetector = true; //Boolean set to true (basically everything is true)
    string ErrorMessageText = "There has been a error"; //has to be in either '' or "" to write strings


}

//Excersise: 
//1: Create a new Variable called wallet as an integer
//2: Than lets create a boolean called spend
//3: Create a string with the name notifyspend
//4: Intialize the wallet to 500
//5: set the value of spend to false
//6: add the string literal (or string value) "You have spent money" to notifityspend.
